### Modular Component Architecture (NEW!)

The codebase has recently undergone a major refactoring to break down monolithic screens into highly modular, reusable, and easy-to-maintain components:
- **components/auth/** - Self-contained components for complex authentication flows (modals, validation inputs).
- **components/evaluations/** - Sub-components explicitly handling student grade uploads and evaluation displays.
- **components/folder/** - Reusable requirement list items and modular folder structural components.
- **components/profile/**, **components/home/**, **components/chat/** - Dedicated component ecosystems for each major feature area, ensuring the `app/` screen files remain purely compositional.
- **components/ui/** - Core native elements bridging React Native / iOS / Android UI primitives.
